            <h2>Saving on Food: Cheap & Delicious</h2>
            <p>Japanese food doesn't have to be expensive. Here are the secrets to fueling your trip without spending all your yen.</p>
            <article>
                <h3>Konbini Magic (Convenience Stores)</h3>
                <p>Don't underestimate 7-Eleven, Lawson, and FamilyMart. They offer fresh, high-quality, and incredibly cheap meals. Look for onigiri (rice balls), sandwiches, and bento boxes. They often have sales near closing time!</p>

                <h3>Local Ramen & Soba Stands</h3>
                <p>Seek out small, local ramen or soba shops, often marked by a simple curtain (noren). A delicious, hot bowl can often be found for under ¥1000 ($6.58 US Dollars). Look for ticket vending machines outside—they mean fast, cheap service.</p>

                <h3>Supermarket Discounts</h3>
                <p>If you're near a major supermarket (like SEIYU or LIFE) near 8 PM, you'll often find significant discounts (30-50% off) on prepared foods like sushi, tempura, and grilled fish. A perfect budget dinner!</p>

                <h3>Hostels and Guesthouses</h3>
                <p>The most common budget option. Modern Japanese hostels are clean, safe, and often feature excellent common areas. Expect prices around ¥2500 - ¥4000 ($16.45 to $26.32 US Dollars) per night.</p>

                <h3>Capsule Hotels</h3>
                <p>A uniquely Japanese experience. Though they can sometimes be more expensive than hostels, they offer privacy and a quiet pod. Great for a single night, often costing ¥3000 - ¥5500 ($19.73 to $36.18 US Dollars).</p>

                <h3>Affordable Ryokans (tradiditional Japanese Inn)</h3>
                <p>Finding a cheap ryokan (traditional inn) is a challenge, but possible outside major cities. Look for small, family-run establishments in less touristy areas for a taste of traditional hospitality for around ¥6000 ($39.49 US Dollars).</p>
