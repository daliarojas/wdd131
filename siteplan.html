            <h2>Affordable Itineraries</h2>
            <p class="section-description"> Pre-planned routes to maximize your experience while minimizing costs. Daily cost estimates provided!</p>
               Estimated daily budget for 2025 Accommodation: $56 USD per day based on a mid-range budget. Prices for hostels start around $30–$50 per night, and budget hotels start around $40–$80 per night.</p>
              <ul> 
               <li>Transportation: $27 USD per day. To save money, consider an IC Card (like Suica or Pasmo) instead of a national JR Pass, especially for shorter trips, or travel by overnight bus for long-distance journeys.</li>
               <li>Food: $23 USD per day. Eating at convenience stores like 7-Eleven or FamilyMart can reduce costs significantly, with meals ranging from $5 to $10. Chain restaurants like Yoshinoya and Sukiya also offer cheap and filling meals for under $7.</li>
               <li> Activities: $2 USD per day. This low average is due to the many free activities available, such as visiting temples, shrines, and parks. Paid attractions often cost under $7.</li>
               <li>Miscellaneous (shopping, etc.): $2 USD per day.</li> Total daily average: $110 USD.
              </ul>
       
              <ul>Approximate costs for itineraries
                  Using the daily average of $110 USD, here is a general breakdown of total costs. Please note that these are estimates for 2025 and individual spending can vary.
                  7-day Golden Route (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka)
                  Trip cost: Approximately $770 USD per person.
                  Transportation note: A 7-day national JR Pass costs $348 USD per person, so it may or may not be the most affordable choice for this itinerary. Compare individual train ticket prices on Google Maps to be sure.</ul>

              <ul>10-day Golden Route + Hakone
                    Trip cost: Approximately $1,100 USD per person.
                    Transportation note: For the segment to Hakone, consider purchasing a Hakone Free Pass, which costs around $35 USD and provides unlimited travel within the region, as well as discounts on attractions.</ul> 

              <ul>14-day Golden Route + Hiroshima and Miyajima
                    Trip cost: Approximately $1,540 USD per person.
                    Transportation note: A 14-day national JR Pass costs $557 USD per person. With the added travel to Hiroshima and Miyajima, this is likely to be a worthwhile expense compared to buying individual Shinkansen tickets.</ul>
                    
              <ul>Other things that affect your budget
                    <li>Travel season: Avoid peak tourist seasons, like late March to early April and August, when prices are highest. Travel in shoulder seasons (May, early June, September–November) for more reasonable prices and pleasant weather.</li>
                    <li>Accommodation choices: Staying in hostels or guesthouses will significantly reduce your daily lodging costs compared to hotels.</li>
                    <li>Booking in advance: Booking flights and accommodation several months in advance can secure better deals.</li>
